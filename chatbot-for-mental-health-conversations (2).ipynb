A crucial component in developing such chatbots is a well-structured dataset, which serves as the foundation for training models to comprehend and respond empathetically to user messages.\n","\n","The dataset available here is a comprehensive collection of conversations related to mental health. It encompasses various conversation types, including basic exchanges, frequently asked questions about mental health, classical therapy discussions, and general advice given to individuals facing anxiety and depression. The primary objective of this dataset is to facilitate the training of a chatbot model that emulates a therapist, capable of providing empathetic and supportive responses to those seeking emotional solace.\n","\n","To train the model effectively, the dataset incorporates the concept of \"intents.\" Each intent represents the underlying purpose behind a user's message. For example, if a user expresses sadness, the associated intent would be \"sad.\" Each intent is accompanied by a set of patterns, which are example messages aligning with the specific intent, as well as corresponding responses that the chatbot should generate based on that intent. Through defining multiple intents and their respective patterns and responses, the model learns to identify user intents and generate relevant and compassionate replies.\n","\n","By utilizing this dataset, researchers and developers can train chatbot models to better understand and support individuals coping with anxiety and depression. The goal is to create a virtual conversational agent that can offer emotional guidance, provide helpful insights, and alleviate some of the challenges faced by those seeking mental health support."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Data Preparation\n","\n","* Load the dataset into a suitable data structure (e.g., Pandas DataFrame).\n","* Examine the dataset to understand its structure and distribution.\n","* Preprocess the data by removing unnecessary characters, converting text to lowercase, and handling any missing values."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_kg_hide-output":true,"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-09T07:31:45.590817Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-09T07:31:45.590388Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-09T07:31:45.634677Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-09T07:31:45.633430Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-09T07:31:45.590776Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n","# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n","# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n","\n","import numpy as np # linear algebra\n","import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n","\n","# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n","# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n","\n","import os\n","for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n","    for filename in filenames:\n","        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n","\n","# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n","# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-09T07:31:56.172524Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-09T07:31:56.172010Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-09T07:31:56.239458Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-09T07:31:56.237876Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-09T07:31:56.172484Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>tag</th>\n","      <th>patterns</th>\n","      <th>responses</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>greeting</td>\n","      <td>[Hi, Hey, Is anyone there?, Hi there, Hello, H...</td>\n","      <td>[Hello there.
